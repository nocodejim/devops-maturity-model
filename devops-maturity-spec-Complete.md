---

## 6. Scoring & Calculation Logic

### 6.1 Gate Score Calculation
```
Gate Score = (Sum of question scores / Maximum possible score) × 100
Example: (12 points earned / 15 points possible) × 100 = 80%
```

### 6.2 Domain Score Calculation
```
Domain Score = Average of all gate scores in domain
Example: (Gate 1.1: 80% + Gate 1.2: 70% + Gate 1.3: 60% + Gate 1.4: 90%) / 4 = 75%
```

### 6.3 Overall Maturity Score
```
Overall Score = Weighted average of domain scores
Recommended weights:
- Source Control: 15%
- Security: 25%
- CI/CD: 25%
- Infrastructure: 20%
- Observability: 15%
```

### 6.4 Maturity Level Mapping
```
0-20%:   Level 1 (Initial)
21-40%:  Level 2 (Developing)
41-60%:  Level 3 (Defined)
61-80%:  Level 4 (Managed)
81-100%: Level 5 (Optimizing)
```
