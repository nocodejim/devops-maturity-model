# Mobile Login Issue - Handoff Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Status:** UNRESOLVED - Needs fresh perspective

---

## TL;DR

Login works perfectly locally but fails from phone on network. Backend shows `200 OK` but frontend shows "invalid email or password". Need to figure out why successful backend response is treated as error in frontend.

---

## The Problem

**Works:** http://localhost:5173 ‚Üí Login succeeds, navigates to dashboard ‚úÖ
**Fails:** http://192.168.44.93:5173 (from phone) ‚Üí Shows "invalid email or password" ‚ùå

**The Mystery:** Backend logs show `200 OK` for phone login attempts:
```
INFO: 172.31.0.1:38352 - "POST /api/auth/login HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

But frontend displays error message to user.

---

## What We Know

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working
- Network connectivity (phone loads login page)
- Backend accessibility (phone can reach http://192.168.44.93:8000/docs)
- Backend authentication (returns 200 OK with JWT token)
- CORS configuration (added 192.168.44.93 to allowed origins)
- Dynamic URL detection (frontend auto-detects backend URL from hostname)
- AuthContext login flow (fixed to update user state before navigation)
- Local login (works 100% from dev PC)

### ‚ùå Still Failing
- Phone login shows "invalid email or password"
- No console access on Chrome Android (can't see debug logs)
- No GET request to /api/auth/me after login (suggests error before getCurrentUser() call)

---

## What We Fixed Today

1. **AuthContext Login Loop**
   - Problem: Login succeeded but immediately redirected back to login page
   - Cause: AuthContext not updated with user after login
   - Fix: Added `login(user)` function to update context before navigation
   - Result: Local login now works ‚úÖ

2. **Hardcoded API URL**
   - Problem: docker-compose.yml had `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api`
   - Cause: Overrode dynamic hostname detection
   - Fix: Removed environment variable, frontend now detects URL from `window.location.hostname`
   - Result: Should work but still fails on mobile ‚ùå

3. **Added Debugging**
   - Extensive console.log throughout login flow
   - Password visibility toggle for mobile
   - API URL detection logging
   - Problem: Can't access logs on mobile browser

## Key Files

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` - Login form and flow (lines 15-50)
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Axios config, URL detection, interceptors (lines 16-55)
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - User state management (lines 42-44)

### Backend
- `backend/app/config.py` - CORS settings (lines 19-24)
- `backend/app/api/auth.py` - Login endpoint

### Config
- `docker-compose.yml` - Removed VITE_API_URL (line 48)

---

## The Mystery

Backend shows successful login:
```
POST /api/auth/login HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

But there's NO follow-up request:
```
GET /api/auth/me HTTP/1.1" 200 OK  ‚Üê This should happen but doesn't
```

**This tells us:** Error happens in frontend AFTER receiving login response but BEFORE calling getCurrentUser().

Possible causes:
1. Frontend error handling catching success as error
2. localStorage.setItem() failing on mobile
3. Response parsing issue
4. Token missing from response
5. Some axios interceptor triggering

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Get Mobile Console Logs (CRITICAL)
```bash
# USB Debugging:
# Phone: Settings ‚Üí Developer Options ‚Üí USB Debugging
# PC: Chrome ‚Üí chrome://inspect/#devices
# Inspect the 192.168.44.93:5173 page
# Check Console for [Login] messages
```

### 2. Test from Dev PC Using Network IP
```bash
# From dev PC browser, go to:
http://192.168.44.93:5173

# This will tell you if it's:
# - Mobile browser specific issue
# - OR network IP issue
```

### 3. Check Response Content
Look at what's actually in the 200 OK response:
- Is access_token present?
- Is response format correct?
- Any CORS headers missing?

## Environment

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# View backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Rebuild frontend (if needed)
docker-compose up -d --build frontend

# Access
Local:   http://localhost:5173
Network: http://192.168.44.93:5173
Backend: http://192.168.44.93:8000
```

---

## Quick Win to Try

Add this to `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` after line 20:

```typescript
console.log('[Login] Login response received:', response)
console.log('[Login] Access token present:', !!response.access_token)
console.log('[Login] Token value:', response.access_token?.substring(0, 20) + '...')

// Add alert for mobile debugging (can see without console)
alert(`Login response: ${response.access_token ? 'Token received' : 'NO TOKEN'}`)
```

This will show an alert on phone confirming if token is received.

Good luck! The answer is probably something simple we've been staring at for hours. Fresh eyes will see it. üöÄ
