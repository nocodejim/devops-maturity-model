## Issues & Lessons

### [2025-10-06 15:04] - Poetry Package Mode Error
- **Issue**: Docker build failed with error: "The current project could not be installed: No file/folder found for package devops-maturity-backend"
- **Impact**: Backend container couldn't build - blocking issue
- **Root Cause**: Poetry was trying to install the project as a package, but this is an application not a library
- **Resolution**: Added `package-mode = false` to `[tool.poetry]` section in pyproject.toml and removed the second `poetry install` step from Dockerfile
- **Lesson**: When using Poetry for applications (not libraries), always set `package-mode = false` or use `--no-root` flag
- **Category**: Dependencies & Packages

### [2025-10-06 15:05] - Frontend npm ci Without Lock File
- **Issue**: Frontend build failed with "npm ci can only install with an existing package-lock.json"
- **Impact**: Frontend container couldn't build - blocking issue
- **Root Cause**: Used `npm ci` but didn't generate or commit package-lock.json file
- **Resolution**: Changed Dockerfile from `npm ci` to `npm install`
- **Lesson**: Either commit package-lock.json files or use `npm install` instead of `npm ci`. For production, should use `npm ci` with committed lock file for reproducible builds
- **Category**: Development Environment
- **TODO**: Generate and commit package-lock.json for reproducible builds

### [2025-10-06 15:08] - Bcrypt Version Incompatibility
- **Issue**: Password hashing failed with "module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'" and "password cannot be longer than 72 bytes"
- **Impact**: Could not create users or test authentication - critical functionality broken
- **Root Cause**: passlib 1.7.4 incompatible with bcrypt 5.x (bcrypt changed internal structure)
- **Resolution**: Pinned bcrypt to version 4.x in pyproject.toml by adding explicit `bcrypt = "^4.0.0"` dependency
- **Lesson**: When using passlib with bcrypt, must pin bcrypt to 4.x until passlib is updated. This is a known compatibility issue
- **Category**: Dependencies & Packages
- **Warning**: A deprecation warning still appears but doesn't affect functionality

### [2025-10-06 15:06] - Docker Compose Version Warning
- **Issue**: Warning message: "the attribute `version` is obsolete"
- **Impact**: Cosmetic only - doesn't affect functionality
- **Resolution**: Can be resolved by removing `version: '3.8'` from docker-compose.yml
- **Lesson**: Docker Compose v2 no longer requires version attribute
- **Category**: Development Environment
- **Priority**: Low

### [2025-10-06 15:11] - Critical Testing Directive
- **Issue**: Initial implementation claimed everything worked based on curl tests showing HTML response, but actual browser testing revealed errors
- **Impact**: Would have delivered broken frontend to user - critical quality issue
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient testing - only tested that endpoints return responses, not that the application actually works
- **Resolution**: User insisted on proper testing, which revealed the issue
- **Lesson**: **ALWAYS test by actually accessing the application in its intended environment, not just checking if endpoints respond**. curl showing HTML â‰  working application. For web apps, test in browser. For APIs, test actual functionality not just HTTP responses.
- **Category**: Process & Workflow
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - This is a fundamental testing principle
- **Action Item**: Never mark frontend as "working" without browser verification. Never mark backend as "working" without functional API testing.

### 4. Code Quality
- Track bugs, type errors, linting issues

### 5. Documentation
- Track gaps in documentation or unclear instructions

### 6. Process & Workflow
- Track workflow inefficiencies or process improvements

### [2025-10-06 15:13] - Invalid Tailwind CSS Class
- **Issue**: Frontend failing with error: "The `border-border` class does not exist"
- **Impact**: Frontend completely non-functional - critical issue that was missed by insufficient testing
- **Root Cause**: Used `@apply border-border;` in index.css, which is a shadcn/ui convention requiring specific theme setup
- **Resolution**: Removed the invalid `@apply border-border;` line from src/index.css
- **Lesson**: Don't use framework-specific conventions without proper setup. Tailwind's `@apply` only works with defined utility classes
- **Category**: Code Quality
- **Detection**: Only discovered after user insisted on proper testing - curl showed HTML response but app was broken

---

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Issues**: 5
- **Critical Issues**: 3 (Poetry package mode, bcrypt incompatibility, Tailwind CSS error)
- **Resolved Issues**: 5
- **Open Issues**: 0
- **TODOs**: 1 (Generate package-lock.json for frontend)
