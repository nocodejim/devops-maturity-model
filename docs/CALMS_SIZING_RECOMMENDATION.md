# CALMS Framework Sizing Recommendation

**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Subject:** Determining Optimal Question Count for CALMS Framework Implementation
**Status:** Pending Management Decision

---

## Executive Summary

As we implement the CALMS DevOps Framework as a second assessment option alongside our technical MVP framework, we need to determine the appropriate scope and question count.

**Key Decision:** Should CALMS have 25-30 questions (90 minutes) or 100 questions (5 hours)?

**Recommendation:** Implement CALMS as a **lightweight 25-30 question assessment** to differentiate it from the technical MVP framework and align with its intended purpose as an organizational readiness tool.

---

## Background

The CALMS framework (Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing) was created by Jez Humble to assess organizational readiness for DevOps transformation. It focuses on cultural and organizational capabilities rather than technical implementation details.

Our current MVP framework has:
- 5 domains
- 20 gates (4 per domain)
- 100 questions (5 per gate)
- Estimated completion time: 60-90 minutes
- Target audience: DevOps engineers and technical practitioners

---

## The Question: How Many Questions for CALMS?

We have three options for structuring the CALMS framework:

### Option 1: Light & Fast (RECOMMENDED)
**25-30 total questions (5-6 questions per domain)**

### Option 2: Balanced
**50 total questions (10 questions per domain)**

### Option 3: Match MVP Framework Structure
**100 total questions (same as MVP framework)**

---

## Option Comparison

| Factor | Option 1: Light (25-30Q) | Option 2: Balanced (50Q) | Option 3: Match MVP (100Q) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Completion Time** | 90 minutes ✅ | 150 minutes (2.5 hrs) | 300 minutes (5 hrs) |
| **Target Audience** | Executives, cross-functional | Team leads, managers | Deep organizational audit |
| **Use Case** | Workshop, quick readiness | Detailed readiness | Comprehensive analysis |
| **Differentiation** | Clearly distinct from MVP ✅ | Somewhat distinct | Very similar to MVP |
| **Completion Rate** | High (short commitment) ✅ | Moderate | Low (long commitment) |
| **Business-Friendly** | Yes ✅ | Moderate | Technical/detailed |
| **Granularity** | High-level insights | Moderate detail | Highly detailed |
| **Development Effort** | Low (25-30 questions) ✅ | Medium (50 questions) | High (100 questions) |
| **Alignment with CALMS Purpose** | Strong ✅ | Good | Misaligned |

## Detailed Analysis

### Option 1: Light & Fast (25-30 Questions) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Structure:**
- 5 domains (Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing)
- 5-6 questions per domain
- No gate subdivision needed
- Direct assessment of each pillar's maturity

**Example - Culture Domain (6 questions):**
1. How well do Dev and Ops teams collaborate on problems?
2. How are failures and mistakes handled?
3. Who is accountable for production uptime?
4. How transparent is information sharing?
5. Does leadership actively support DevOps initiatives?
6. Are teams incentivized for collaboration and outcomes?

**Completion Time:** ~90 minutes
- 25-30 questions × 3 minutes per question = 75-90 minutes
- Workshop-friendly
- Can be completed in single session

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Aligns with CALMS intent** - Quick organizational readiness check
- ✅ **Business-friendly** - Executives can complete without fatigue
- ✅ **High completion rate** - Short commitment increases participation
- ✅ **Clearly differentiated** - Distinct from technical MVP framework
- ✅ **Workshop compatible** - Can be used in facilitated sessions
- ✅ **Faster to develop** - Only 25-30 questions to write/validate
- ✅ **Actionable insights** - Focused questions yield clear next steps

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Less granular than MVP framework
- ⚠️ May miss some organizational nuances
- ⚠️ Different structure than MVP (no gates)

**Best For:**
- Pre-transformation readiness assessment
- Executive leadership teams
- Cross-functional workshops
- Initial organizational baseline

---

### Option 2: Balanced (50 Questions)

**Structure:**
- 5 domains
- 2 sub-areas per domain (10 total)
- 5 questions per sub-area

**Completion Time:** ~150 minutes (2.5 hours)

**Pros:**
- ✅ More detailed than Option 1
- ✅ Still manageable in extended session
- ✅ Provides moderate granularity

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Long for organizational assessment
- ⚠️ May discourage busy executives
- ⚠️ Still different structure from MVP
- ⚠️ More development effort required

**Best For:**
- Organizations wanting deeper organizational analysis
- When executive time is available
- When CALMS is primary assessment (not complementary)

---

### Option 3: Match MVP Framework (100 Questions)

**Structure:**
- 5 domains
- 4 gates per domain (20 total)
- 5 questions per gate
- Identical structure to MVP framework

**Completion Time:** ~300 minutes (5 hours)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Consistent structure across frameworks
- ✅ Easier to build (reuse MVP pattern)
- ✅ Very comprehensive
- ✅ Parallel complexity to technical assessment

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Way too long** for CALMS's intended purpose
- ❌ **Not business-friendly** - 5 hours is unrealistic for executives
- ❌ **Over-engineered** - Cultural assessment doesn't need this depth
- ❌ **Low differentiation** - Too similar to MVP framework
- ❌ **High development cost** - 100 questions to write
- ❌ **Low completion rate** - Length will discourage participation

**Best For:**
- Academic research requiring comprehensive data
- Organizations with significant time investment capacity
- (Not recommended for typical use case)

## Industry Context

Based on research of CALMS assessments in the industry:

**How CALMS is Typically Used:**
- "Self-assessment workshop" with stakeholders
- "Quick survey to gather readiness feedback"
- "Starting point for transformation discussion"
- "Leadership alignment session"

**Common Characteristics:**
- Completed in single sitting (1-2 hours)
- Facilitator-led discussions
- Focus on high-level capabilities, not technical details
- Designed to spark conversation, not provide exhaustive audit

**None of the industry examples suggest a 5-hour, 100-question assessment.**

## Framework Positioning Strategy

### Recommended: Complementary Frameworks with Distinct Purposes

| Assessment Need | Recommended Framework | Questions | Time | Audience |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------|------|----------|
| **"Are we ready for DevOps?"** | CALMS (25-30Q) | 25-30 | 90 min | Executives, cross-functional |
| **"How well do we do DevOps?"** | MVP (100Q) | 100 | 90+ min | Engineers, practitioners |

**Value Proposition:**
- **CALMS** = Organizational readiness and cultural maturity
- **MVP** = Technical implementation and practice maturity

**Usage Pattern:**
1. Start with **CALMS** to assess organizational readiness
2. Identify cultural/organizational gaps
3. Follow with **MVP** to assess technical capabilities
4. Create comprehensive transformation roadmap

This approach provides:
- ✅ Clear differentiation between frameworks
- ✅ Different target audiences
- ✅ Complementary insights (culture + technical)
- ✅ Marketing advantage: "Two industry-standard frameworks"
